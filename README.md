# PLL
PLL stands for "Phase Lock Loop" and it's a common stage on many analog and digital comunication devices. But in this case it is implemented as a resource to get a sort of "virtual axe" linking the movement of two different individually-driven motors. The position of each motor is sensed by means of encoders and a corrected signal is provided in each step to the second motor so that its position and speed gets closer to those of the first motor.
